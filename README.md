# World_Weather_Analysis

The challenge was to add the weather description to the weather data. Then, create input statements to filter the data for low and high temperature weather preferences to be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, four cities were chosen to create a travel itinerary. Lastly, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map was created.
